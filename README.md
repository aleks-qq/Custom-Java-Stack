# Custom Java Stack

My own Stack to 'replicate' the java.util's stack class. Made it so I would understand 'the stack'.
For now it has the methods push and pop which works according to the LIFO (last in first out) principle. 
It can also list the stack and tell how many items are in the stack.

Basically you have listItem-objects which are stored in the Stack-object.
The main method is located in menu class.
You have 5 options what to do:

> - Add data to the stack
> - Delete data from the stack
> - Print the content of the stack
> - Print how much data is contained in the stack
> - Quit the application


'The code' is a mixture of English and Finnish
